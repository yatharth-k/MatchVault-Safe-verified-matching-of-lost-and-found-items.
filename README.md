## 🧠 Overview

**MatchVault** is an intelligent Lost & Found web application that facilitates **secure, AI-based matching** between users who lose items and those who find them. To ensure privacy and prevent fraud, users are allowed to connect only when AI detects a high-confidence match between lost and found reports.

The platform **rewards good samaritans** with points, badges, and gift cards from affiliated brands for helping return found items — making it both impactful and incentivized.
